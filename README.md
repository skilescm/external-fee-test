# External Feed Test Submission

This project was built using ejected create-react-app.
Axios for API interactions.
All CSS was hand done, no use of themed components.
An SVG asset is in the Components -> Icons folder. It was set as a component to show competency with rendering themable SVG assets.

I have built this application in a manner that it can support future additions and expansions. Having a future proof architecture is very important to me.
